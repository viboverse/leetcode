# ðŸš€ LeetCode Practice (JS/TS)

Short and simple: this repo is my daily practice solving LeetCode problems and small JavaScript exercises. I keep solutions minimal, readable, and focused on learning.

## Whatâ€™s inside

- `30-days-of-javascript/`: small JS challenges and patterns.
- `random-problems/`: LeetCode-style solutions (mostly JS/TS), grouped by difficulty.

## How to run

- Most files are standalone scripts. Open a file and run it with Node.

```bash
# examples (pick a script)
node 30-days-of-javascript/day05-map/script.js
node random-problems/easy/1-two-sum/script.ts   # if using ts-node or tsx , or compile first
```

## Notes

- No frameworks or deps; just quick problem-solving.
- I prefer simple, well-named variables and small helper functions.

Thatâ€™s it â€” just daily reps to get better at algorithms and JavaScript.
